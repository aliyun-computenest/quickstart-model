## Introduction
Cosmos-Reason1 is a fully customizable multimodal AI reasoning model, specifically built for understanding motion, object interactions, and spatiotemporal relationships. Based on Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, the Cosmos-Reason1 model can interpret visual inputs, predict outcomes based on given prompts, and reward optimal decisions. The model implements reasoning based on real-world physical laws, generating clear and context-aware natural language responses. Cosmos-Reason1 can enhance synthetic data curation capabilities by acting as a discriminator or by annotating vast amounts of visual data. Cosmos-Reason1 is post-trained on Qwen2.5-VL using physical common sense and embodied reasoning data, and employs Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques.
