## Introduction
QwQ is the reasoning model in the Qwen series. Compared to traditional instruction-tuned models, QwQ, which possesses thinking and reasoning capabilities, significantly enhances performance in downstream tasksâ€”especially when solving complex problems. It features the following key characteristics:

- **Mathematical Reasoning Ability**: Supports parsing and solving mathematical problems such as algebra, geometry, and calculus, enabling step-by-step derivation of complex formulas.
- **Code Generation and Comprehension**: Can generate high-quality Python/Java/C++ code based on natural language descriptions and supports code debugging and optimization.
- **Multi-step Reasoning**: Utilizes the "Chain-of-Thought" mechanism to address complex problems incrementally, such as deriving mathematical proofs step by step.
- **Reinforcement Learning Fine-tuning**: Optimizes reasoning accuracy through feedback mechanisms, demonstrating exceptional performance in tasks requiring precise calculations.
