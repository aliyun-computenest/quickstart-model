## Introduction
On September 19th, at the Yunqi Conference, Alibaba Cloud released Qwen2.5, the new generation of open-source models in the Tongyi Qianwen series. The flagship model, Qwen2.5-72B, outperforms Llama-405B in performance. All models in the Qwen2.5 series have been pre-trained on 18T tokens of data, showing an overall performance improvement of over 18% compared to Qwen2, with more knowledge and stronger programming and mathematical abilities. The Qwen2.5-72B model scores as high as 86.8, 88.2, and 83.1 on the MMLU-rudex benchmark (testing general knowledge), MBPP benchmark (testing coding ability), and MATH benchmark (testing mathematical ability) respectively.

Qwen2.5 supports a context length of up to 128K and can generate content up to 8K in length. The model possesses powerful multilingual capabilities, supporting over 29 languages including Chinese, English, French, Spanish, Russian, Japanese, Vietnamese, and Arabic. It can smoothly respond to diverse system prompts, enabling tasks such as role-playing and chatbot functionalities. Qwen2.5 shows notable improvements in instruction following, understanding structured data (like tables), and generating structured output (especially JSON).

In terms of language models, Qwen2.5 has open-sourced 7 sizes: 0.5B, 1.5B, 3B, 7B, 14B, 32B, and 72B. Tongyi Qianwen 2.5-32B-Instruct (Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct) is a version obtained by fine-tuning Tongyi Qianwen 2.5-32B (Qwen2.5-32B) for instruction following, capable of generating text that complies with instructions based on given prompts and conversation history.

This model can be deployed directly. The directly deployed model uses Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct as the pre-trained model and can continue writing based on any text provided by the user.
