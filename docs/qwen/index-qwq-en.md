## Introduction
QwQ is the reasoning model in the Qwen series. Compared to traditional instruction-tuned models, QwQ, which possesses thinking and reasoning capabilities, significantly enhances performance in downstream tasksâ€”especially when solving complex problems. It features the following key characteristics:

- **Mathematical Reasoning Ability**: Supports parsing and solving mathematical problems such as algebra, geometry, and calculus, enabling step-by-step derivation of complex formulas.
- **Code Generation and Comprehension**: Can generate high-quality Python/Java/C++ code based on natural language descriptions and supports code debugging and optimization.
- **Multi-step Reasoning**: Utilizes the "Chain-of-Thought" mechanism to address complex problems incrementally, such as deriving mathematical proofs step by step.
- **Reinforcement Learning Fine-tuning**: Optimizes reasoning accuracy through feedback mechanisms, demonstrating exceptional performance in tasks requiring precise calculations.

## Usage Instructions
After completing the model deployment, you can view the usage methods on the service instance overview page in Compute Nest. It provides API call examples, intranet access addresses, public network access addresses, and ApiKey. The following sections will explain how to access and use these.

### API Calls
#### Curl Command Call

![img.png](../image-en/img-api-call.png)

You can directly use the API call example from the service instance overview page for Curl command calls. The specific structure for calling the model API is as follows:

Where ${ServerIP} can be filled with the IP address from either the intranet or public network address, ${ApiKey} is the ApiKey, and ${ModelName} is the model name.
```shell
curl -X Post http://${ServerIP}:8000/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${ApiKey}" \
  -d '{
    "model": "${ModelName}",
    "messages": [
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "Write a letter to my daughter from the future 2035, telling her to study technology well, be the master of technology, and promote technological and economic development; she is currently in 3rd grade"
      }
    ]
  }'
```

#### Python Call
Here's a Python example code: Where ${ApiKey} needs to be filled with the ApiKey from the page; ${ServerUrl} needs to be filled with the public or intranet address from the page, including /v1.
```python
from openai import OpenAI

##### API Configuration #####
openai_api_key = "${ApiKey}"
openai_api_base = "${ServerUrl}"

client = OpenAI(
    api_key=openai_api_key,
    base_url=openai_api_base,
)

models = client.models.list()
model = models.data[0].id
print(model)


def main():

    stream = True

    chat_completion = client.chat.completions.create(
        messages=[
            {
                "role": "user",
                "content": [
                    {
                        "type": "text",
                        "text": "Hello, introduce yourself, the more detailed the better.",
                    }
                ],
            }
        ],
        model=model,
        max_completion_tokens=1024,
        stream=stream,
    )

    if stream:
        for chunk in chat_completion:
            print(chunk.choices[0].delta.content, end="")
    else:
        result = chat_completion.choices[0].message.content
        print(result)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
